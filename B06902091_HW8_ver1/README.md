# 2020CV Homework 8

Write a program which does:<br>
(a) Generate noisy images with gaussian noise(amplitude of 10 and 30)<br>
(b) Generate noisy images with salt-and-pepper noise( probability 0.1 and 0.05)<br>
(c) Use the 3x3, 5x5 box filter on images generated by (a)(b)<br>
(d) Use 3x3, 5x5 median filter on images generated by (a)(b)<br>
(e) Use both opening-then-closing and closing-then opening filter (using the octogonal 3-5-5-5-3 kernel, value = 0) on images generated by (a)(b)<br>
You must calculate the signal-to-ratio (SNR) for each instance(4 noisy images and 24 processed images)<br>
